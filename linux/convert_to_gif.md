# Convert to GIF

ImageMagick can convert things to GIFs really easily. No command line options really required, just a source and destination. It figures out what to do based on the file extensions.

## Convert WEBP to GIF

```
convert image.webp image.gif
```

## Convert MP4 to GIF

```
convert movie.mp4 movie.gif
```
