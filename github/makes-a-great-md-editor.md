Github has a number of tools to make editing markdown super quick and easy.

* Usually the default commit message is often what you want, especially when writing something like this. It looks like its just a suggestion, but if you leave it blank and commit it will use that default.
* The markdown editor works in any browser and has a preview feature that supports syntax highlighting. Clearly using some sort of server post back with an ugly transition (as of this writing), but it works.
